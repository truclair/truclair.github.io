        <div>
            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Truclair.</p>
            <p>I am a digital artist, animator, and storyteller. Right now, I'm busy with university and focusing on things like studio projects, but a long term goal of mine has been to develop a web series of hope and despair with an eccentric cast of animal characters. The story isn't fully fleshed out, but throughout the years, as I gain more experience transitioning into adulthood and learning about the innerworkings of our world, I grow closer to accomplishing my dream.</p>
            <p>To those of you who would like to support me, you are absolutely welcome to follow me while I find my footing in the animation industry! For those who are just here for a quick peek- I don't have much to offer, but I hope you find it entertaining and fun to see what work I have.</p>
            <p>Thanks for popping in, and hopefully I'll get to see you around!</p>
